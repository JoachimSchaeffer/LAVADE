# LAVADE: Latent Variable Demonstrator

This repository contains a demonstrator to build intuition on latent variable approaches and regression approaches in general.

The widget was written in MATLAB_R2021b by using the MATLAB app designer toolbox.
For everyone without a MATLAB license, a html version is available too, that can be executed in every browser.

Structure: The folder code contains the software. All other folders contain scripts to reproduce the figures and resutls in the associated paper.

Main File: 01Code/lavade.mlapp

Please send me a message in case you would appreciate a python version.
