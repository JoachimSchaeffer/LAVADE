# LAVADE

This repositoiry contains a demonstrator to build intuition on latent variable approaches and regression apporaches in general. 

The widget was written in MATLAB_R2019b by using the MATLAB app designer toolbox. 
For everone without a MATLAB license, a html version is availbale too, that can be executed in every browser. 

I am planning to work on a python version of this demonstrator as well. 
Please send me a message in case you would appreciate a python version.
