# LAVADE: Latent Variable Method Demonstrator
Version 1.0.0

This repository contains a MATLAB app to build intuition on latent variable approaches and regression approaches in general.

The LAVADE software contains processed data (ATR-FTIR spectra, Raman Spectra, LFP Battery Data, more information can be found here 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0098135422003489
And here (open access): https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08132

The app was written in MATLAB_R2021a by using the MATLAB app designer toolbox.
If you want an installable version that does not require a MATLAB license, please drop me a message. 

Structure: The folder code contains the source code. 
01Code/lavade.mlapp Main file of the app. 
Data.m Data class definition, modify this class including functions to implement your own/additional datasets. 

Feel free to start a python version; I'd be happy to assist and to host it here too.
