# LAVADE: Latent Variable Demonstrator

This repository contains a demonstrator to build intuition on latent variable approaches and regression approaches in general.

The widget was written in MATLAB_R2021a by using the MATLAB app designer toolbox.
For everyone without a MATLAB license, a html version is available too, that can be executed in every browser.

Structure: The folder code contains the software. 

Main File: 01Code/lavade.mlapp

Feel free to start a python version, I'd be happy to host it here too.

Have fun!
